# RZEssentials

## Overview

RZEssentials is an app which allows users to join an exclusive community of content creators buying and selling used or new content creations products. Users have to create a log in to be admitted access to the library of user generated and curated content/services. Users can create their own products to sell them online to other users.

## Approach

My approach for this project was based on creating a community store for all content creators to share their equipment as not everyone has the capital to buy all the new equipment to create beautiful and attractive content for the internet! The use creates a log in to be admitted to the community, if they want to read about what the community is, they can click the side nav to learn before even signing up to see the library. Once the user is logged in they can see the library of all the user generated products on sale. These products have descriptions, a picture, price, and a buy feature where the user can click and buy an item directly! 

I took the approach where I started creating the functions before setting the CSS layout for the store. This time around I had a better understanding of what the app was going to look and function like. I started with creating the functionality first and worked the first 3-4 days on the app to be fully functional while adding some css just to have a self-understanding of where everything was and how knowing where things were would make my workflow better. This ended up creating some really good progress in the beginign but some limitations ensued as some of the features I came across weren't things I anticipated adding to the website in my backlog, this created some back and forth when I was trying to create the user experience and the UI for the app. 

I used Notion App again for my project success, it has proven very useful in my last project and this time it provided me a phenomenal framework to follow as a I progressed through creating the application. It allowed me to update my status as I progressed through each task and whenever I would come back to work on the app I would know where I ended and where I needed to start each day. It also kept my JavaScript notes/comments clean and concise. 


## Version 2

In the future, I'd like to add the following functionalities: 

    - Create a 'Cart' page that is user specific.
    - Create Permissions for who can/can't delete and edit products.
    - Create "Vote" functionality on the user as well as the products to have the best ones rank higher.
